Deep Learning with Applications to Telecom
==============================================

## Install Dependencies

To install the required packages, simply do:

    $ pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Great! You're all set, you just need to start Jupyter now.

We recommend that you create a virtual environment and install the required software there.

## Starting Jupyter
To start Jupyter, simply type:

    $ jupyter notebook

This should open up your browser, and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with the contents of the current directory. If your browser does not open automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/tree).

Next, just click on any `*.ipynb` to open a Jupyter notebook.

That's it! Now, have fun learning TensorFlow 2!
